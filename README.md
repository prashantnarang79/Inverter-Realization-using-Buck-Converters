# Buck Converter-Based Single-Phase and Three-Phase Inverter Using Differential Load Connections

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design and hardware implementation of **single-phase and three-phase DC-AC inverters** using **differential connection of buck converters**, as described in **Section 6.1.4 â€” Differential Connection of the Load** from *Fundamentals of Power Electronics* by **Robert W. Erickson**.

Initially, a **single-phase inverter** was realized using two buck converters connected in differential mode. This approach was extended to a **three-phase inverter** by configuring **three buck converters**, each generating a phase voltage with respect to a virtual neutral point formed by the average of the three outputs.

All circuits were modeled in MATLAB for validation and then implemented in hardware using **TL494-based PWM generation** and **custom-soldered buck converter boards**.
